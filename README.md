Bip uses the power of touch to imitate selected CSS transitions

Acknowledgements:
- Calculations are based on linear transitions, so swiping and clicking might look slightly different when using longer transition times and/or a complex bezier.
- cssValues should be single values, shorthand CSS is not supported
